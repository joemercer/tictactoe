- start button
- first to reach 500 wins, then reset
- someone has to press start again to get it to work
- organize scripts from newest to oldest

- needs to respond back to the client if the game is over
- so we can update ui

- games need a timestamp. ugh. all queries need to reflect this

- on start in client we need to not show start game if game is going.

- style the intro page (just a little bit)

- add just a little transition to the animation

- games take one additional turn after finishing
- games that end in a win on the last turn end up counting as a tie
- add a reset button for when things get hairy
-- just clears all existing games and starts a new game

- add my favicon (just for kicks)
- add link to my website (not just twitter)
