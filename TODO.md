- ugh

-- on createGame in server we need to create a series first and add it to the thing
-- we need to query this collection on the client to get the startTime and gamesNeededToFinish
-- we need to use this internally on the server to calculate those same properties
-- we can store the winner here (yay!)

- - this is super hard for some reason





- add a reset button for when things get hairy
-- just clears all existing games and starts a new game




- add link to my website (not just twitter)
